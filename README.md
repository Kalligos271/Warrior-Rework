- Respect the class's legacy and gameplay identity

## ðŸ”¥ Highlights

- New **modular paths** with cross-spec offensive cooldowns (e.g., Recklessness for Arms)
- Smart **rage generation scaling**
- Optional AoE/CC branches and **mobility freedom**
- Deep synergy between spec-defining talents and core class mechanics
- PvP tools that promote counterplay and fairness (not FOTM domination)
